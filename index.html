          For me, the greatest thrills in life are traveling, estate sales, and finding the exact right words to express an idea.

        <p>
          With 7+ years copywriting experience, I've worked with agencies, tech startups, universities, and nonprofits creating and curating awesome content that brings brands to life. I'm happiest in a collaborative, forward-thinking environment (with good coffee).

              As a Senior Copywriter at this national agency, I collaborated with designers and art directors on full marketing campaigns for dozens of clients. I oversaw copywriting for the Microsoft annual conference, including newsletters, landing pages, and on-site activations. One notable project (a personal favorite, honestly!) was orchestrating real-time social media and activations for InterContinental Hotels Group during the 2018 Super Bowl in Atlanta.

              My role as Marketing Communication Coordinator at SAGE was a unique one. One on side, I oversaw B2B marketing to drive sales and customer retention—company newsletters, tradeshow materials, as well as the corporate blog and editorial calendar—in addition to the internal corporate communications. The other half of the job involved developing marketing materials for our clients to use&mdash;B2C emails and newsletters, print catalogues, and social media. During my time here, I worked with the design team to develop creative assets and modernize the company’s marketing campaigns, and increased blog readership by 300%.
